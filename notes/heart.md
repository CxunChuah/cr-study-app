### *Where* is the HEART LOCATED?

![Heart Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CxunChuah/cr-study-app/main/images/heart-diagram.png)


- The heart lies in the thoracic cavity in the mediastinum (the space between the lungs).
- It lies obliquely, a little more to the left>right, and presents a base above, and an apex below.
- The apex下面尖尖的 is about 9cm to the left of the midline at the level of 5th intercostal space:
    - *A little below the nipple and slightly nearer the midline.*
- *The base上面扁的 extends up to the level of the 2nd rib.*

| Inferiorly | The apex rests on the central tendon of the diaphragm. |
| --- | --- |
| Superiorly | The great blood vessels *(Aorta; Superior Vena Cava; Pulmonary Artery/Veins).* |
| Posteriorly | The oesophagus, trachea, Lt & Rt bronchus, descending aorta, inferior vena cava and thoracic vertebrae.  |
| Laterally | The lungs - The left lung overlaps the left side of the heart.  |
| Anteriorly  | The sternum, ribs, and the intercostl muscles.  |

### *What* are the STRUCTURES of the HEART WALL?

![Heart Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CxunChuah/cr-study-app/main/images/heart-diagram.png)

The heart wall is composed of 3 layers of tissue: 

- Pericardium (outermost, double-walled)
- Myocardium (middle)
- Endocardium (innermost)

| Pericardium | The outermost layer of the heart is a double-walled sac termed the pericardium, anchored to the diaphragm inferiorly and connective tissue of the great vessels superiorly. 

Outer-Outer Layer : Parietal Pericardium
Tough fibrous layer of dense irregular connective tissue. 

Between 2 Layers: Pericardial space / Pericardial cavity 
Closed space filled with approx 10 to 20 mL of clear pericardial fluid. 
This fluid separates the 2 layers and minimizes friction during cardiac contraction. 

***In patients with inflammation of the pericardium (Pericarditis), fluid may accumulate in the closed pericardial space producing cardiac tamponade —> Compromised cardiac function and contractility caused by build up of fluid in the pericardial space. It is also commonly noted following a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.*** 

Inner Layer : Visceral Pericardium (Epicardium)
Thin smooth and moist serous layer. |
| --- | --- |
| Myocardium | The middle layer of the heart is termed the myocardium. 

It is the layer of the heart that facilitates the pumping action of the heart as a result of the presence of contractile elements. 

It is composed of specialised *cardiac muscle*, found only in the heart, with involuntary contraction. 

The ends of the cells and their branches are in very close contact with the ends and branches adjacent cells. This arrangement gives cardiac muscle the appearance of being a sheet of muscle rather than a very large number of individual cells. Because of the end-to-end continuity of the fibres, each one DOES NOT need to have a separate nerve supply. 

When an impulse is initiated, it spreads from cell to cell via the branches and intercalated disc over the whole ‘sheet’ of muscle, causing contraction. The ‘sheet’ arrangement of the myocardium enables the atria and ventricles to contract in a coordinated and efficient manner. 

The myocardium is the thickest at the apex (下面尖尖的）and thins out towards the base（上面扁扁的）. This reflects the amount of work each chamber contributes to the pumping of blood. It is thickest in the left ventricle, which has greatest workload.  |
| Endocardium | The innermost layer of the heart is termed the endocardium.

This layer consists of simple squamous endothelium overlying a thin areolar tissue layer. The tissue of the endocardium forms the inner lining of the chambers of the heart and is continuous with the tissue of the valves and the endothelium of blood vessels. 

Since the endocardium and valves share similar tissue, patients with endocarditis must be considered for valvular dysfunction. Endocardial infections can spread into valvular tissue, developing vegetations (irregular growths made of germs and cell pieces that form a mass/clump) on the valve.

***Bronchopulmonary hygiene procedures, such as percussions and vibrations, are CONTRAINDICATED for patients with unstable vegetations as they may dislodge, move as emboli, and cause embolic stroke!***  |

### *What* are the STRUCTURES of the HEART?

The heart is divided into Rt & Lt halves by a longitudinal (interventricular & interatrial) septum.

- The Rt side of the heart receives deoxygenated venous blood,
- The Lt side of the heart receives oxygenated blood.

Each half of the heart is made up of 2 chambers: atria (superior) & ventricles (inferior).

Thus, the 4 chambers are:

- Rt Atrium
- Rt Ventricle
- Lt Atrium
- Lt Ventricle

Let’s dig into it!

![image.png](image%202.png)

| Right Atrium | The chamber of the right atrium consists of a smooth posterior and medial inner wall. Anteriorly and laterally exist parallel muscle bundles known as pectinate muscles. 

Both right & left atria have small earlike extensions called auricles that help to increase volume within the chambers. 

**Function**
The Rt Atrium receives deoxygenated blood from 3 major vessels:
- The superior vena cava collects venous blood from the head & upper extremities
- The inferior vena cava collects blood from the trunk & lower extremities
- The coronary sinus collects venous blood specifically from the heart. It carries the blood into Rt Atrium above tricuspid valve. 
***Normal diastolic pressures to enable filling are 0 to 8 mmHg (clinically referred as central venous pressure).*  

*The effective contraction of the pectinate muscles of the atria account for approx 15 to 20% of cardiac output (CO) — the atrial kick. In patient with abnormal electrical conduction causing a quivering of the atria (**atrial fibrillation**), the mechanical contractile ability of the pectinate muscles is reduced, resulting in a low atrial kick and compromised CO.

Instead of one strong signal, there are hundreds of tiny chaotic signals. Atria just quiver or flutter (not squeeze properly). Blood doesn’t move efficiently → leads to blood stasis in the atria.*  |
| --- | --- |
| Right Ventricle | The Rt Ventricle is shaped like a crescent or triangle, enabling it to eject large volumes of deoxygenated blood through a small valve into a low-pressure pulmonary system. 

Blood within the Rt Ventricle is received from the Rt Atrium through a one-way valve present between the atrium & ventricle (tricuspid AV valve). 

It can be considered in 2 parts: 
- A posteroinferior inflow tract, termed the body, which contains the tricuspid valve, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, and trabeculated myocardium
- An anterosuperior outflow tract, called the infundibulum from which the pulmonary trunk arises. 

Function
It ejects deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonic semilunar valve into pulmonary artery. 

*Patients with chronic lung pathologies (**COPD, pulmonary fibrosis**), during periods of exacerbation, often present with hypoxemia and increased pressure within the pulmonary vasculature, termed pulmonary artery hypertension, caused by compromised perfusion capacity to the lung. The increase pressure within the pulmonary artery increases the workload on the Rt Ventricle, causing **cor pulmonale** (Right sided heart failure caused by lung problems,) or right ventricular hypertrophy and resultant right ventricular failure.*  |
| Left Atrium | The Lt Atrium is divided from the right atrium by an interatrial septum.

It has a relatively thicker wall than Rt atrium. Why? To adapt to higher pressures of oxygenated blood coming from lungs. The O2 blood enters this chamber posteriorly via the pulmonary veins and exert a sphincter-like action to prevent backflow of blood during contraction of atria (ventricular filling). 

The normal filling pressure of the left ventricle is between 4 and 12 mm Hg. During the ventricular filling, the blood enters the Lt ventricle via MITRAL VALVE (AV - Bicuspid valve). 

Regurgitation or insufficiency of the mitral valve causes blood to accumulate in the left atrium and elevate left atrial pressures. These chronically elevated pressures alter the integrity of the atrial wall and predispose the individual to developing a quivering of the atria wall (atrial fibrillation) and potential blood clots within the Lt Atrium.  |

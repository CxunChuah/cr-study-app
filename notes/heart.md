# 🫀 Cardiovascular System

Welcome to your heart anatomy explainer guide — made simple, fun, and medically accurate! 💖

## 📍 Location of the Heart

The heart is located in the **mediastinum**, the space between the lungs, behind the sternum, and slightly to the left of the midline.

> 🧠 **Tip:** It's protected by the rib cage and lies on the diaphragm.

## 🧱 Layers of the Heart Wall

| Layer         | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧥 Pericardium | Double-walled sac surrounding the heart (outermost) |
| 💪 Myocardium  | Muscular middle layer — does the pumping            |
| 🧽 Endocardium | Smooth inner lining in contact with blood           |

> 💡 The **myocardium** is thickest in the left ventricle!

> 🚨 Clinical Note: Infections of the endocardium can affect the heart valves — this is called **infective endocarditis**.

## 💓 Chambers of the Heart

| Chamber         | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Right Atrium    | Receives deoxygenated blood (SVC/IVC) |
| Right Ventricle | Pumps blood to lungs (via PA)         |
| Left Atrium     | Receives oxygenated blood (from lungs) |
| Left Ventricle  | Pumps oxygenated blood to body         |

> 🧠 **Note:** The left ventricle has the **thickest wall** due to higher pressure circulation.

## 🚪 Valves of the Heart

| Valve              | Location                            | Function                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tricuspid          | Between right atrium & ventricle    | Prevents backflow        |
| Bicuspid (Mitral)  | Between left atrium & ventricle     | Prevents backflow        |
| Pulmonary Valve    | Right ventricle → pulmonary artery  | Stops return into RV     |
| Aortic Valve       | Left ventricle → aorta              | Stops return into LV     |

> 🧬 **All valves ensure one-way blood flow**. AV valves use **chordae tendineae** + **papillary muscles** to stay shut under pressure.

## ⚡ Cardiac Conduction System

| Node/Structure   | Function                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SA Node          | "Pacemaker" – initiates heartbeat                |
| AV Node          | Delays impulse, allows ventricular filling       |
| Bundle of His    | Carries signal through interventricular septum   |
| Purkinje Fibers  | Distribute signal to ventricles (contraction!)   |

> 🧠 The **fibrous ring** electrically isolates the atria from the ventricles. Only the AV node bridges the signal.

## 🩸 Major Vessels of the Heart

| Vessel             | Function                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Superior Vena Cava | Returns deoxygenated blood to RA      |
| Inferior Vena Cava | Same (from lower body)                |
| Pulmonary Arteries | Carry deoxygenated blood to lungs     |
| Pulmonary Veins    | Bring oxygenated blood to LA          |
| Aorta              | Main artery to the body               |

> ❤️ **Remember:** Arteries = AWAY from heart; Veins = RETURN to heart.

# 🎯 Revision Flashcards (Self Check)

### 🔹 Q1: Which chamber has the thickest myocardium?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
💪 **Left Ventricle** — it pumps to the entire systemic circulation.
</details>

---

### 🔹 Q2: What prevents the AV valves from inverting?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
**Chordae tendineae** and **papillary muscles**.
</details>

---

### 🔹 Q3: What is the function of the AV node?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
It **delays the impulse** to allow time for ventricular filling.
</details>

---

### 🔹 Q4: Which layer is affected in endocarditis?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
🧽 **Endocardium**, especially affecting the valves.
</details>

---

### 🔹 Q5: Where does the SA node send the initial signal?
<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>
Across the atrial muscle → to the **AV node**.
